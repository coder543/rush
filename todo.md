- for loops are currently broken because iterators are not a thing yet
- add more builtins, especially related to getting file properties and reading/writing files
- the interactive shell needs to be rewritten almost entirely
	- each command will run on a separate thread, transmitting output back through a channel
	- this means that all commands will be asynchronous
	- commands can run until they choose to exit or the user kills them
	- since output is directed over unique channels for each process, updated output from a particular process will be able to be output to the correct location
	- the interactive shell...
		- currently does not understand wide characters like tabs, which means text is allowed to overflow the right-hand side and cause a crash
		- does not support scrolling or even showing only the latest output, it just shows the earliest output
		- needs to support inline input fields, buttons, scrollbars, and other exciting things
